# This script runs qodem under X11.  It looks for qodem-x11 first.  If
# that is not found, it then looks for uxterm, konsole, gnome-terminal
# and x-terminal-emulator (in that order) and starts it up with qodem
# inside it.

# Qodem needs a Unicode font that includes the CP437 glyphs.  Terminus
# does the job nicely.  bolkhov-vga (uni_vga) does even better, but is
# a bit small on large displays.  If uxterm is found, then the
# following fonts are searched in order to see if any is present, if
# not found then a default Terminus is used.  For any other terminal
# (gnome-terminal, x-terminal-emulator, ...), we do not try to set the
# font.
FONTS="-*-terminus-*-r-normal-*-20-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-* -bolkhov-vga-medium-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-*"
